defined problems using first principles thinking

encountered a new concept in a podcast
    the concept
        First principles thinking
    description by GPT-3
        First principles thinking is an approach to problem solving that relies on breaking down problems into the most basic components. It involves breaking down complex problems into simple, fundamental truths that cannot be deduced any further, and then using logic to build up from there to find a solution.

        I was already using the problem solving technique without knowing that there was a name for it.

created db user, configured password and privileges
    1. Create a new user with the desired privileges:
        CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';
    2. Grant privileges to the new user: 
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO username;
    3. Create the schema: 
        CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;
    4. Grant the user access to the schema: 
        GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
    5. Grant the user access to objects in the schema: 
        GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
    6. Grant the user access to sequences in the schema: 
        GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
    7. Grant the user access to functions in the schema: 
        GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
    8. Grant the user access to types in the schema: 
        GRANT USAGE ON ALL TYPES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;

created db schemas for Mockaroo

generated relational test data (CSV) 
    how
        using Mockaroo's web app,
            create schemas
            generate data set for referenced tables
            in the FK field of referencing tables, specify "dataset column" and reference tables
            generate data sets for tables containing FKs
            download CSVs to project directory

imported test data (CSV) into all postgresql tables
    how 
        create
            file.sql
                COPY FROM
        use
            psql
                \i <file.sql>

issues
    thestore.store.orders.total is a randomly generated data
        solution
            use the data in ordered_items and orders to calculate a real total value
    all tables are dropped at the end of psql session
